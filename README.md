# Just Do It

I will create a ToDo list customized for my daily tasks and more.

## What I want to use?

- First of all I want to learn about github actions and CI/CD.
  So, the first step will be that.
- Next, I will use `create-react-app` or `vite` to generate default React project.
- And last, I will code the ToDo app with what I know over the years as Frontend Dev.

## Current Version

0.0.1 - Init commit and first steps
